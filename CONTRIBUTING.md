Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

pyxplr could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official pyxplr docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

If you are proposing a feature:

  are welcome :)
  
## Submitting Your Contributions

### Internal Contributions

We utilize [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) approach. If you have been granted access to the repository, please follow this approach. All development should be done in feature-specific branches branched off `master`. Once ready, submit a pull request from your feature branch to `master`.

### External Contributions  

Even if you are not a team member, your contributions are very welcome. In this case please use fork+PR approach - fork the repository, work on your changes and then submit a pull request back to the repository. We will be glad to review and hopefully approve it!
