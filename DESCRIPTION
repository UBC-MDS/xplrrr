Package: xplrrr
Title: This package makes exploratory data analysis (EDA) simple and seamless. EDA is a crucial phase in the data science workflow as it allows us get a fist glimpse of the data. It is important to identify statistical characteristics of the data so that we can properly set up the rest of the analysis.
